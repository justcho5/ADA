                    Amazon’s Review Dataset consists of metadata and 142.8 million product reviews from May 1996 to July 2014. The dataset contains the ratings, review text, helpfulness, and product metadata, including descriptions, category information, price etc. This dataset has a wealth of information that can inform us about consumers and how they rate or review products.

In particular, the goal of this project was to observe a specific population of consumers—those who receive products for free or at discounted prices in exchange for “honest” reviews.
