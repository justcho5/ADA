### Feature analysis

We can now start to have a look at the distribution of the various features. 

First of all: overall score distribution.


We can see that more than half of the reviews gave five stars to the product independently of the price. The low proportion of 1 and 2 star reviews suggests that customers are very likely to be satisfied with the product they purchased.

Let's now consider the number of reviews by month of the year.




The number of reviews seems to be highest during winter and spring and lower during autumn, with January being the month with the highest number of reviews. The biggest shopping time in the year is during the christmas holidays and we imagine that reviews are written the next month after the product has been used for some time.

We can now start looking at the prices of the items.
