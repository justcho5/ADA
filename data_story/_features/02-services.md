# Observations

In the abstract for our project we planned to investigate whether factors such as a product's price or the season in which a review is written can affect the score given to a product. When analyzing the dataset we found that such correlations seem to be absent in the data and the only other feature that correlates with the review's score is the sentiment score (positive or negative) that the review's extended summary expresses. Furthermore we have discovered that in some of the categories the length of the review positively correlates with the price tier of the product, suggesting that users might write more detailed reviews for products that they spent more money on. It seems that just looking at the numbers in the data doesn't tell us too much about what we want to know and we might need to conduct further analysis on the text of the reviews or the features of the product (such as looking at what other items are related to the one being reviewed or seeing if we can predict whether a review is going to be more useful according to which words the author uses and how high the sentimental score of the review is.
